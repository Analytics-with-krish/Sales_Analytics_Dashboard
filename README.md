# Power BI Sales Analysis Dashboard
This Power BI project is built using two datasets: Orders.csv and Details.csv. The dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of sales performance, product-wise trends, and customer behavior.
Key insights include total sales, order volumes, top-performing products, and monthly sales breakdowns. Visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and slicers make the analysis user-friendly and dynamic.
This project demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into meaningful business intelligence to support better decision-making.
